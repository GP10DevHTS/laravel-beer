# Laravel Beer üç∫

A Laravel package for developers who love **Nile beer** and clean code. Enjoy coding with a cold brew in hand, and let Laravel do the heavy lifting.

Made for **Nugsoft's Start of Year 2025**. üçª

## Installation:
1. Grab a **Nile beer** üçª.
2. Install Composer: [Composer Installation](https://getcomposer.org)
3. Run:
    ```bash
    composer require gp10devhts/laravel-beer
    ```

Enjoy your code, enjoy your beer!

## Usage

This package provides a `BeerService` that you can use to get a friendly beer-related message.

### 1. Dependency Injection

You can inject `Gp10devhts\LaravelBeer\BeerService` into your controllers or other classes:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Gp10devhts\LaravelBeer\BeerService; // Import the service
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class YourController extends Controller
{
    protected $beerService;

    public function __construct(BeerService $beerService)
    {
        $this->beerService = $beerService;
    }

    public function showBeerMessage(Request $request)
    {
        $message = $this->beerService->getColdNileBeer();
        // Example: return to a view
        return view('your-view', ['beerMessage' => $message]);
        // Or, return as JSON
        // return response()->json(['message' => $message]);
    }
}
```

### 2. Using `app()` or `resolve()` Helpers

You can also resolve the service directly from Laravel's service container:

```php
// Using the app() helper
$beerService = app(Gp10devhts\LaravelBeer\BeerService::class);
$message = $beerService->getColdNileBeer();
// echo $message; // "Here's a cold Nile Beer for you!"

// Or using the resolve() helper
$anotherBeerServiceInstance = resolve(Gp10devhts\LaravelBeer\BeerService::class);
$anotherMessage = $anotherBeerServiceInstance->getColdNileBeer();
// echo $anotherMessage; // "Here's a cold Nile Beer for you!"
```

The `BeerService` is registered as a singleton, so you'll always receive the same instance within a single request lifecycle.

### 3. Using the Artisan Command

This package also comes with a fun Artisan command to serve you a virtual beer message directly in your terminal!

To use it, simply run:

```bash
php artisan beer:serve
```

This will display a random beer-related quote, a fun message, or the classic "Here's a cold Nile Beer for you!" message.

#### More Fun Commands:

*   **`php artisan beer:cheers {name?}`**
    *   Sends a cheers message. You can optionally provide a name for a personalized touch.
    *   Example: `php artisan beer:cheers Jules`
    *   Output: "üçª Cheers, Jules! May your code flow as smoothly as a well-poured pint."

*   **`php artisan beer:wisdom`**
    *   Shares a piece of beer-related wisdom or coding philosophy.
    *   Example: `php artisan beer:wisdom`
    *   Output: "üç∫ Beer Wisdom: Code without tests is like a beer without a head. Something's missing."

*   **`php artisan beer:happy-hour`**
    *   Announces happy hour or displays a fun related message, sometimes with ASCII art.
    *   Example: `php artisan beer:happy-hour`
    *   Output: "It's Beer O'Clock Somewhere! üçª Why not take a short break?" (or ASCII art)

*   **`php artisan beer:empty-keg`**
    *   Clears your application's view and application caches, with themed messages.
    *   Example: `php artisan beer:empty-keg`
    *   Output: "üõ¢Ô∏è Time to empty the old kegs..." followed by Artisan output from `view:clear` and `cache:clear`.

*   **`php artisan beer:open`**
    *   Serves your Laravel project using `php artisan serve`, but with some encouraging beer-themed messages.
    *   Example: `php artisan beer:open`
    *   Output: "üç∫ Tapping a fresh keg and firing up the server..." followed by the standard `php artisan serve` output.

*   **`php artisan beer:test {--passthru options}`**
    *   Runs your application's tests using `php artisan test`. It displays some beer-themed ASCII art and messages before running the tests.
    *   You can pass options to the underlying `artisan test` command (e.g., `--coverage`, or a test file/filter if supported by your setup).
    *   Example: `php artisan beer:test`
    *   Example with options: `php artisan beer:test --coverage`
    *   Output: Beer ASCII art, themed messages, and then the standard `php artisan test` output.
